# Architecture

This DEP describes the conceptual reference architecture for Decentralised Data Ecosystems supported 
by the broader set of DEP standards.


## Vision

The Storage API:

- must provide a simple interface to asset content via standard web protocols (HTTP / HTTPS)
- must support any type of asset content (assuming it can be expressed as an ordered sequence of byte values)
- must allow content to be addressed via the Asset's DID
- must integrate with relevant authentication and authorisation mechanisms
- should be easy to use and consistent with existing Internet tools and standards as far as possible
