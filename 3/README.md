# Architecture

This DEP describes the conceptual reference architecture for Decentralised Data Ecosystems supported 
by the broader set of DEP standards.

## Vision

We envision a world where:

- Data and AI services can be harnessed by all for the good of humanity, and
not controlled by a handful of powerful gatekeepers. 
- The costs of developing AI solutions are minimised, so that the value of the "long tail" of Data and AI
assets can be realised.
- Interoperability is built into the ecosystem from the ground up, so that solutions can be built to
span across a broad range of participants without expensive bespoke integration work.

It is the goal of this DEP to outline a reference architecture and architectural principles that can support
this vision. 

## Principles

- No centralised point of control
- Decentralised ownership of assets and services
- Support for orchestration of Data Supply Lines
- Decentralised trust rules
- Abstraction from specific technology choices
- Support for arbitrary data formats
- Available over the public internet
- Peer-to-peer model

## Motivation

> “Being abstract is something profoundly different from being vague... The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise. ”
