# About

This is the Data Ecosystem Proposal project, which defines a set of standards for the development of
interoperable, decentralised data ecosystems.

You should consider adopting the DEP standards if:

- You need to orchestrate data services across multiple organisations / participants
- You need the ability to remotely invoke operations on a variety of data sources
- You wish to unlock the value of existing data assets and services to a broader ecosystem
- You plan to make use of the capabilities of the Ocean Network, or other decentralised systems designed for data exchange, but wish to maintain a level of abstraction away from specific implementation details.
